Lesson Types and Subscribed Trimesters7.1 Multiple Lesson Types- The app will include both 'Edición Para Adultos' and 'InVerso' Sabbath School lessons.- Users can select which type of lesson they want to study from the homepage or profile settings.- Lessons will be organized by quarter (trimestre) and displayed in a clean, scrollable layout.7.2 Cohort-based Subscriptions- If a user is invited to a cohort, they are automatically subscribed to the trimester that cohort is following.- Subscribed trimesters appear in a dedicated section of the home screen.- Users can still access and explore other lesson types and trimesters, even outside their cohort.7.3 Cohort-Content Link- The content shown inside a cohort is always tied to its assigned trimester and lesson type.- This ensures all participants are studying the same material, while retaining the flexibility to study other content independently.
